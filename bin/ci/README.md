# CI/CD and GitHub Actions

## What is CI/CD?

**CI/CD** stands for **Continuous Integration** and **Continuous Deployment/Delivery** - a set of practices that automate the software development lifecycle.

### Continuous Integration (CI)
- **Automated Testing**: Every code change triggers automated tests
- **Early Bug Detection**: Issues are caught before they reach production
- **Code Quality**: Automated checks for code style, security, and standards
- **Build Verification**: Ensures code compiles and builds successfully

### Continuous Deployment/Delivery (CD)
- **Continuous Delivery**: Code is automatically prepared for release
- **Continuous Deployment**: Code is automatically deployed to production
- **Automated Releases**: Reduces manual deployment errors
- **Faster Time-to-Market**: Features reach users more quickly

## GitHub Actions

**GitHub Actions** is GitHub's built-in CI/CD platform that automates workflows directly in your repository.

### Key Concepts

#### 1. **Workflows**
- YAML files stored in `.github/workflows/`
- Define automated processes triggered by events
- Can run on GitHub-hosted or self-hosted runners

#### 2. **Events (Triggers)**
Common triggers include:
- `push` - When code is pushed to repository
- `pull_request` - When PRs are opened/updated
- `schedule` - Time-based triggers (cron jobs)
- `workflow_dispatch` - Manual triggers
- `release` - When releases are created

#### 3. **Jobs**
- Units of work that run on virtual machines
- Can run in parallel or sequentially
- Each job runs in a fresh environment

#### 4. **Steps**
- Individual tasks within a job
- Can run commands or use pre-built actions
- Execute sequentially within a job

#### 5. **Actions**
- Reusable units of code
- Available in GitHub Marketplace
- Can be custom-built or community-contributed

### Basic Workflow Example

```yaml name=.github/workflows/ci.yml
name: CI

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main, develop ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v4
    
    - name: Setup Node.js
      uses: actions/setup-node@v4
      with:
        node-version: '18'
        cache: 'npm'
    
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: npm ci
    
    - name: Run tests
      run: npm test
    
    - name: Run linting
      run: npm run lint
```

### Common Use Cases

#### 1. **Automated Testing**
```yaml
- name: Run unit tests
  run: npm test

- name: Run integration tests
  run: npm run test:integration

- name: Upload coverage reports
  uses: codecov/codecov-action@v3
```

#### 2. **Build and Deploy**
```yaml
- name: Build application
  run: npm run build

- name: Deploy to staging
  if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/develop'
  run: |
    echo "Deploying to staging environment"
    # Deployment commands here
```

#### 3. **Release Automation**
```yaml
- name: Create Release
  uses: actions/create-release@v1
  with:
    tag_name: ${{ github.ref }}
    release_name: Release ${{ github.ref }}
  env:
    GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

### Advanced Features

#### 1. **Matrix Builds**
Test across multiple environments:
```yaml
strategy:
  matrix:
    node-version: [16, 18, 20]
    os: [ubuntu-latest, windows-latest, macos-latest]
```

#### 2. **Conditional Execution**
```yaml
- name: Deploy to production
  if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main' && github.event_name == 'push'
  run: ./deploy-prod.sh
```

#### 3. **Secrets Management**
```yaml
- name: Deploy with secrets
  env:
    API_KEY: ${{ secrets.API_KEY }}
    DATABASE_URL: ${{ secrets.DATABASE_URL }}
  run: ./deploy.sh
```

#### 4. **Artifact Management**
```yaml
- name: Upload build artifacts
  uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
  with:
    name: build-files
    path: dist/
```

### Benefits of GitHub Actions

1. **Native Integration**: Built into GitHub, no external tools needed
2. **Rich Ecosystem**: Thousands of pre-built actions
3. **Flexible Triggers**: Respond to any GitHub event
4. **Scalable**: Runs on GitHub's infrastructure
5. **Cost-Effective**: Free tier available for public repositories
6. **Security**: Built-in secrets management

### Best Practices

1. **Keep workflows simple and focused**
2. **Use caching to speed up builds**
3. **Fail fast - run quick tests first**
4. **Use matrix builds for cross-platform testing**
5. **Secure secrets properly**
6. **Use meaningful workflow and job names**
7. **Add status badges to your README**

### Your PowerShell Script Context

Your script for incrementing CI tags would fit perfectly in a GitHub Actions workflow for automated versioning:

```yaml name=.github/workflows/increment-ci-tag.yml
name: Increment CI Tag

on:
  workflow_dispatch:  # Manual trigger
  push:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  increment-tag:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      with:
        fetch-depth: 0  # Fetch all history for tags
    
    - name: Setup PowerShell
      uses: actions/setup-powershell@v1
    
    - name: Increment CI Tag
      run: ./increment-ci-tag.ps1
      shell: pwsh
    
    - name: Push tags
      run: git push --tags
```

GitHub Actions transforms your development workflow by automating repetitive tasks, ensuring code quality, and enabling rapid, reliable deployments.
