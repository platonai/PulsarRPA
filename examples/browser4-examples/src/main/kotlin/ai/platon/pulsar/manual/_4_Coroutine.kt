/**
 * # Kotlin Coroutines Integration - Native Async Support
 *
 * This example demonstrates how to use Browser4 with Kotlin coroutines,
 * which provide a more natural way to write async code compared to callbacks.
 *
 * ## Coroutine Patterns Covered:
 * 1. **Concurrent Launches** - Running multiple loads in parallel with launch()
 * 2. **Deferred Results** - Using async() to get results from coroutines
 *
 * ## Key Concepts:
 * - **CoroutineScope**: Defines the lifecycle of coroutines
 * - **Dispatchers.Default**: Optimized for CPU-intensive work
 * - **launch()**: Fire-and-forget coroutine (no return value)
 * - **async()**: Coroutine that returns a Deferred result
 * - **joinAll()**: Wait for all jobs to complete
 * - **awaitAll()**: Collect results from all deferred operations
 *
 * ## Benefits over Java Async:
 * - More readable sequential-looking code
 * - Better structured concurrency
 * - Easier error handling
 * - Natural cancellation support
 *
 * ## AI Integration Notes:
 * - Use coroutines for complex async workflows
 * - Suspend functions can contain AI analysis steps
 * - CoroutineScope controls the lifecycle of background tasks
 *

 * @see CoroutineScope Defines coroutine lifecycle

     * Pattern 1: Concurrent Launches with Fire-and-Forget
     *
     * Uses launch() to start multiple page loads concurrently.
     * Each launch creates a new coroutine that runs independently.
     *
     * AI Note: launch() is best when you don't need the return value,
     * or when you process results inside the coroutine.

     * Pattern 2: Async with Collected Results
     *
     * Uses async() inside launch() to collect Deferred results.
     * Results are gathered in a thread-safe queue for later processing.
     *
     * AI Note: This pattern is useful when you need to collect all results
     * after concurrent processing, for example for batch database insertion.
