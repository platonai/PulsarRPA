    (such as BrowserContext, Browser, Page etc.) are expected to be called on the same thread where the 
    Playwright object was created or proper synchronization should be implemented to ensure only one thread calls 
    Playwright methods at any given time. Having said that it's okay to create multiple Playwright instances each on its
