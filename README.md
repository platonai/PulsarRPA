## üöÄ Quick start

### Chat about a webpage:

```kotlin
val document = session.loadDocument(url)
val response = session.chat("Tell me something about this webpage", document)
```

Example code: [kotlin](/pulsar-app/pulsar-examples/src/main/kotlin/ai/platon/pulsar/examples/llm/ChatAboutPage.kt).

### Tell the browser to get jobs done:

```kotlin
val prompts = """
move cursor to the element with id 'title' and click it
scroll to middle
scroll to top
get the text of the element with id 'title'
"""

val eventHandlers = DefaultPageEventHandlers()
eventHandlers.browseEventHandlers.onDocumentActuallyReady.addLast { page, driver ->
    val result = session.instruct(prompts, driver)
}
session.open(url, eventHandlers)
```

Example code: [kotlin](/pulsar-app/pulsar-examples/src/main/kotlin/ai/platon/pulsar/examples/llm/TalkToActivePage.kt).

### One line of code to scrape:

```kotlin
session.scrapeOutPages(
    "https://www.amazon.com/",  "-outLink a[href~=/dp/]", listOf("#title", "#acrCustomerReviewText"))
```

### Crawl with Robotic Process Automation (RPA):

```kotlin
val options = session.options(args)
val event = options.eventHandlers.browseEventHandlers
event.onBrowserLaunched.addLast { page, driver ->
    // warp up the browser to avoid being blocked by the website,
    // or choose the global settings, such as your location.
    warnUpBrowser(page, driver)
}
event.onWillFetch.addLast { page, driver ->
    // have to visit a referrer page before we can visit the desired page
    waitForReferrer(page, driver)
    // websites may prevent us from opening too many pages at a time, so we should open links one by one.
    waitForPreviousPage(page, driver)
}
event.onWillCheckDocumentState.addLast { page, driver ->
    // wait for a special fields to appear on the page
    driver.waitForSelector("body h1[itemprop=name]")
    // close the mask layer, it might be promotions, ads, or something else.
    driver.click(".mask-layer-close-button")
}
// visit the URL and trigger events
session.load(url, options)
```

Example code: [kotlin](/pulsar-app/pulsar-examples/src/main/kotlin/ai/platon/pulsar/examples/sites/food/dianping/RestaurantCrawler.kt).

### Resolve *super complex* web data extraction problems using X-SQL:

```sql
select
    dom_first_text(dom, '#productTitle') as title,
    dom_first_text(dom, '#bylineInfo') as brand,
    dom_first_text(dom, '#price tr td:matches(^Price) ~ td, #corePrice_desktop tr td:matches(^Price) ~ td') as price,
    dom_first_text(dom, '#acrCustomerReviewText') as ratings,
    str_first_float(dom_first_text(dom, '#reviewsMedley .AverageCustomerReviews span:contains(out of)'), 0.0) as score
from load_and_select('https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C1H26C46  -i 1s -njr 3', 'body');
```

Example code:

* [X-SQL to scrape 100+ fields from an Amazon's product page](https://github.com/platonai/exotic-amazon/tree/main/src/main/resources/sites/amazon/crawl/parse/sql/crawl)
* [X-SQLs to scrape all types of Amazon webpages](https://github.com/platonai/exotic-amazon/tree/main/src/main/resources/sites/amazon/crawl/parse/sql/crawl)

### Continuous web crawling:

```kotlin
fun main() {
    val context = PulsarContexts.create()

    val parseHandler = { _: WebPage, document: FeaturedDocument ->
        // use the document
        // ...
        // and then extract further hyperlinks
        context.submitAll(document.selectHyperlinks("a[href~=/dp/]"))
    }
    val urls = LinkExtractors.fromResource("seeds10.txt")
        .map { ParsableHyperlink("$it -refresh", parseHandler) }
    context.submitAll(urls).await()
}
```

Example code: [kotlin](/pulsar-app/pulsar-examples/src/main/kotlin/ai/platon/pulsar/examples/_5_ContinuousCrawler.kt), [java](/pulsar-app/pulsar-examples/src/main/java/ai/platon/pulsar/examples/ContinuousCrawler.java).

## üßÆ PulsarRPA as an executable jar

We have released a standalone executable JAR based on PulsarRPA, which includes:

- Data collection examples from top-tier websites.
- A mini-program for automatic information extraction based on self-supervised machine learning. The AI algorithm can identify all fields on detail pages with field accuracy exceeding 99%.
- A mini-program that automatically learns and outputs all collection rules based on self-supervised machine learning.
- The ability to execute web data collection tasks directly from the command line without writing any code.
- An upgraded PulsarRPA server that allows you to send SQL statements to collect web data.
- A Web UI where you can write SQL statements and send them to the server.

Download [PulsarRPAPro](https://github.com/platonai/PulsarRPAPro#download) and explore its capabilities with a single command line:

```shell
java -jar PulsarRPAPro.jar
```

## üéÅ PulsarRPA as a java library

The simplest way to leverage the power of PulsarRPA is to add it to your project as a library.

Maven:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>ai.platon.pulsar</groupId>
    <artifactId>pulsar-bom</artifactId>
    <version>VERSION</version>
</dependency>
```

Gradle:

```kotlin
implementation("ai.platon.pulsar:pulsar-bom:VERSION")
```

Clone the template project from github.com:
[kotlin](https://github.com/platonai/pulsar-kotlin-template),
[java-17](https://github.com/platonai/pulsar-java-17-template).

Start your own large-scale web crawling projects based on our commercial-grade open source projects: [PulsarRPAPro](https://github.com/platonai/PulsarRPAPro), [Exotic-amazon](https://github.com/platonai/exotic-amazon).

Check the [quick start](docs/get-started/2basic-usage.md) for more details.

# üåê PulsarRPA as a REST Service

When PulsarRPA runs as a REST service, X-SQL can be used to scrape webpages or to query web data directly at any time, from anywhere, without opening an IDE.

## Build from Source

```
git clone https://github.com/platonai/PulsarRPA.git
cd PulsarRPA && bin/build-run.sh
```

For Chinese developers, we strongly suggest you to follow [this](/bin/tools/maven/maven-settings.md) instruction to accelerate the building process.

## Use X-SQL to Query the Web

Start the pulsar server if it is not started:

```shell
bin/pulsar
```

Scrape a webpage in another terminal window:

```shell
bin/scrape.sh
```

The bash script is straightforward. It merely uses curl to send a POST request with an X-SQL.

```shell
curl -X POST --location "http://localhost:8182/api/x/e" -H "Content-Type: text/plain" -d "
  select
      dom_base_uri(dom) as url,
      dom_first_text(dom, '#productTitle') as title,
      dom_first_slim_html(dom, 'img:expr(width > 400)') as img
  from load_and_select('https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C1H26C46', 'body');
"
```

Example code: [bash](bin/scrape.sh), [PowerShell](bin/scrape.ps1), [batch](bin/scrape.bat), [java](/pulsar-client/src/main/java/ai/platon/pulsar/client/Scraper.java), [kotlin](/pulsar-client/src/main/kotlin/ai/platon/pulsar/client/Scraper.kt), [php](/pulsar-client/src/main/php/Scraper.php).

# üìä Logs & Metrics

PulsarRPA has carefully designed the logging and metrics subsystem to record every event that occurs in the system. PulsarRPA logs the status for every load execution, providing a clear and comprehensive overview of system performance. This detailed logging allows for quick assessment of the system‚Äôs health and efficiency. It answers key questions such as: Is the system operating smoothly? How many pages have been successfully retrieved? How many attempts were made to reload pages? And how many proxy IP addresses have been utilized? This information is invaluable for monitoring and troubleshooting purposes, ensuring that any issues can be promptly identified and addressed.

By focusing on a concise set of indicators, you can unlock a deeper understanding of the system‚Äôs overall condition: üíØ üíî üóô  ?üíø üîÉ ü§∫.

Typical page loading logs are shown below. Check the [log-format](docs/log-format.md) to learn how to read the logs and gain insight into the state of the entire system at a glance.
