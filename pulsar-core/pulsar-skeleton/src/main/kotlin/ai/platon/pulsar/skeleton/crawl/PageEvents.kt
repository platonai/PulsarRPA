/**
 * Event handlers during the crawl phase of the webpage lifecycle.
 *
 * Crawl event handlers are triggered at the beginning and end of the crawl iteration,
 * wrapping around the load and browse phases. They are ideal for:
 * - Filtering or modifying URLs before processing
 * - Handling crawl results after page loading
 * - Implementing crawl-level logic (e.g., rate limiting, deduplication)
 *
 * ## Event Execution Order
 * ```
 * crawl.onWillLoad → [Load Phase] → [Browse Phase] → crawl.onLoaded
 * ```
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 * ```kotlin
 * crawlEventHandlers.apply {
 *     onWillLoad.addLast { url: UrlAware ->
 *         // Filter or modify URL before loading
 *         if (url.url.contains("skip-this")) null else url
 *     }
 *     onLoaded.addLast { url, page ->
 *         // Process results after loading
 *         println("Loaded: ${url.url}, success: ${page != null}")
 *     }
 * }
 * ```

 * @see LoadEventHandlers for load-phase events

 * 2. **[BrowseEventHandlers]** - Events during the interactive browsing stage

 * 3. **[CrawlEventHandlers]** - Events in the crawl stage (before and after loading)
 *    - URL filtering, result handling
 *
 * ## Complete Event Lifecycle (Execution Order)
 * ```
 * 1.  crawl.onWillLoad
 * 2.  load.onNormalize
 * 3.  load.onWillLoad
 * 4.  load.onWillFetch
 * 5.  browse.onWillLaunchBrowser
 * 6.  browse.onBrowserLaunched
 * 7.  browse.onWillFetch
 * 8.  browse.onWillNavigate
 * 9.  browse.onNavigated
 * 10. browse.onWillInteract
 * 11. browse.onWillCheckDocumentState
 * 12. browse.onDocumentFullyLoaded
 * 13. browse.onWillScroll
 * 14. browse.onDidScroll
 * 15. browse.onDocumentSteady         <-- Best for custom RPA actions
 * 16. browse.onWillComputeFeature
 * 17. browse.onFeatureComputed
 * 18. browse.onDidInteract
 * 19. browse.onWillStopTab
 * 20. browse.onTabStopped
 * 21. browse.onFetched
 * 22. load.onFetched
 * 23. load.onWillParse
 * 24. load.onWillParseHTMLDocument
 * 25. load.onHTMLDocumentParsed       <-- Best for data extraction
 * 26. load.onParsed
 * 27. load.onLoaded
 * 28. crawl.onLoaded

 *
 * ## Usage Patterns
 *
 * ### With ListenableHyperlink
 * ```kotlin
 * val handlers = DefaultPageEventHandlers()
 * handlers.loadEventHandlers.onLoaded.addLast { page ->
 *     println("Loaded: ${page.url}")
 * }
 * val link = ListenableHyperlink(url, args = "-parse", eventHandlers = handlers)
 * session.submit(link)
 * ```
 *
 * ### With LoadOptions
 * ```kotlin
 * val options = session.options("-parse")
 * options.eventHandlers.browseEventHandlers.onDocumentSteady.addLast { page, driver ->
 *     driver.click("#button")
 * }
 * session.load(url, options)
 * ```
 *
 * ### Using Aliases for Brevity
 * ```kotlin
 * handlers.le.onLoaded.addLast { page -> }  // loadEventHandlers
 * handlers.be.onDocumentSteady.addLast { page, driver -> }  // browseEventHandlers
 * handlers.ce.onWillLoad.addLast { url -> url }  // crawlEventHandlers
 * ```
 *
