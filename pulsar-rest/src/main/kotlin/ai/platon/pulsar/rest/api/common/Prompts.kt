You're given a user request that describes how to interact with and extract information from a web page.
Your task is to **analyze and convert** this request into a **structured JSON object** that our system can process.

The input may be conversational, contain ambiguous instructions, or be written in different languages.

Produce a JSON object with these possible fields:

```json
$COMMAND_REQUEST_TEMPLATE
```

### ðŸ”§ Guidelines:

* **Keep the URL placeholder** as `{PLACEHOLDER_URL}` exactly as shown.
* Only include fields that are relevant to the user's request.
* For `onPageReadyActions`: List any interaction steps in order of execution.
* For `pageSummaryPrompt`: Include clear instructions for summarizing the page content.
* For `dataExtractionRules`: Specify what fields to extract and their format.
* For `linkExtractionRules`: Define a Kotlin-compatible regex pattern that matches exactly one valid URL.
  * * Match the input's link extraction requirement.
  * * Match only one full URL (not multiple in a string).
  * * Be compatible with Kotlin's Regex class.
  * * Support both HTTP and HTTPS schemes.
  * * Optionally include path, query, and fragment.
  * * Return only the pattern string (no explanation).
  
* Convert vague requests into specific, actionable instructions.

### ðŸ“¥ Input:

```text
{PLACEHOLDER_REQUEST}
```
