const val API_REQUEST_PLAIN_COMMAND_CONVERSION_PROMPT = """
Convert a natural language web automation request into a structured JSON configuration for automated browser interaction and data extraction.

### üéØ Task:
Transform the user's conversational instructions into a precise JSON object that defines browser automation workflow, page interactions, and data extraction requirements.

### üìã JSON Structure:
Use this template with only the fields relevant to the request:

```json
{PLACEHOLDER_REQUEST_JSON_COMMAND_TEMPLATE}
```

### üîß Field Guidelines:

**Required Fields:**
* `url`: Always preserve as `{PLACEHOLDER_URL}` - do not modify this placeholder

**Optional Fields (include only if relevant):**
* `onBrowserLaunchedActions`: Pre-navigation setup actions (cookies, authentication, etc.)
  - Execute in the specified order before loading the target page
  - Common actions: cookie management, login, navigation setup
  
* `onPageReadyActions`: Page interaction steps after initial load
  - Execute in the specified order once the page is fully loaded
  - Common actions: clicking, scrolling, form filling, waiting
  
* `pageSummaryPrompt`: Natural language instructions for page content summarization
  - Be specific about what aspects to focus on
  - Include desired output format or structure
  
* `dataExtractionRules`: Structured data extraction specifications
  - Define exact field names and expected formats
  - Specify selectors, patterns, or identification methods
  
* `uriExtractionRules`: Natural language instructions to extract URIs from the page
  - Will be converted into regex patterns automatically
  - Example: "extract all product links containing '/dp/'"

* `xsql`: X-SQL query to run on the page's DOM
    - Use for advanced data extraction or processing
    - Should be a valid X-SQL query string

### ‚ö° Conversion Rules:
* **Specificity**: Convert vague instructions into concrete, executable actions
* **Order**: Sequence actions logically (setup ‚Üí navigation ‚Üí interaction ‚Üí extraction)
* **Clarity**: Use precise language that eliminates ambiguity
* **Relevance**: Only include fields that address the user's actual requirements
* **Actionability**: Every instruction should be directly executable by automation

### üåê Language Support:
Process requests in any language and output JSON with English field values.

### üì• User Request:

```text
{PLACEHOLDER_REQUEST_PLAIN_COMMAND_TEMPLATE}
```

### üì§ Expected Output:
Return only the JSON object - no explanations or additional text.
"""

const val CONVERT_RESPONSE_TO_MARKDOWN_PROMPT = """
Convert the following JSON string into a well-structured Markdown document.

### üéØ Output Requirements:

The output must include:

#### üßæ Human-Readable Explanation
Present the JSON content as structured Markdown sections:

1. **Page Summary** ‚Äî A brief summary of the page content
2. **Extracted Data** ‚Äî Key-value pairs extracted from the page (if any)
3. **Extracted Links** ‚Äî List of URIs/links found on the page (if any)

#### üì¶ JSON Representation
Include the original JSON string as a fenced code block at the end of the document.

### üîß JSON to Convert:

```json
{PLACEHOLDER_JSON_STRING}
```
"""

const val CONVERT_URI_DESCRIPTION_TO_REGEX_PROMPT = """
Convert the following URI description into a Kotlin-compatible regex pattern that matches exactly one valid URI.

### üéØ Objective:
Generate a precise regex pattern that captures URIs based on the provided description.

### üîß Requirements:
* **Single Match**: Pattern must match exactly one complete URI (not partial matches or multiple URIs in text)
* **Kotlin Compatibility**: Must work with Kotlin's `Regex` class and standard regex engine
* **Exact Matching**: Pattern should precisely match the URI format described in the input
* **Complete URI**: Match the entire URI from start to end (use anchors if needed)

### üìã Output Format:
* Start with the exact prefix: `Regex: `
* Follow with the regex pattern only
* No explanations, comments, or additional text
* Pattern should be ready to use in `Regex("your_pattern")`

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes:
* Escape special regex characters appropriately for Kotlin
* Consider URI components: scheme, authority, path, query, fragment
* Ensure the pattern is neither too restrictive nor too permissive
* Test mentally against common URI variations if applicable

### üì• Input Description:

```text
{PLACEHOLDER_URI_DESCRIPTION}
```
"""

const val COMMAND_REVISION_TEMPLATE = """
Convert a JSON automation command into clear, numbered steps in plain language.

### üéØ Task:
Transform the structured JSON command into human-readable instructions that explain what the automation will do.

### üîß Guidelines:
* Start with "Visit [url]"
* Convert each action in "onBrowserLaunchedActions" to numbered sub-steps under "When browser launches:"
* Convert each action in "onPageReadyActions" to numbered sub-steps under "When page is ready:"
* Add steps for page summarization, data extraction, and link collection if specified
* Use clear, concise numbered instructions
* Maintain logical action sequence

### üìã Example Output Format:
```
{PLACEHOLDER_REQUEST_PLAIN_COMMAND_TEMPLATE}
```

### üì• JSON Command to Convert:

```json
{PLACEHOLDER_JSON_VALUE}
```

### üì§ Expected Output:
Return only the numbered steps - no explanations or additional text.
