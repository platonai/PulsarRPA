/**
 * We have a collection of typescript functions that we need to run in the browser.
 * First, we build them into a single js file
 * Second, due to framework differences we need to get our script content as a string to avoid pathing issues
 * due to file routing in frameworks like Next.js
 * Playwright allows us to pass in script content directly as a string instead of reading a file from a path
 * https://github.com/browserbase/stagehand/issues/180
 *
 * We can't rely on the normal build process for stagehand, because we need our script content as a string so that the import *just works*
