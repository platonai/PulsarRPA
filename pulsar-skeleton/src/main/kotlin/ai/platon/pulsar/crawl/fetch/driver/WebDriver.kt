/**
 * [WebDriver] defines a concise interface to visit and interact with web pages,
 * all actions and behaviors are optimized to mimic real people as closely as possible,
 * such as scrolling, clicking, typing text, dragging and dropping, etc.
 *
 * The methods in this interface fall into three categories:
 *
 * * Control of the browser itself
 * * Selection of textContent and attributes of Elements
 * * Interact with the webpage
 *
 * Key methods:
 * * [navigateTo]: open a page.
 * * [scrollDown]: scroll down on a web page to fully load the page,
 * most modern webpages support lazy loading using ajax tech, where the page
 * content only starts to load when it is scrolled into view.
 * * [pageSource]: retrieve the source code of a webpage.
