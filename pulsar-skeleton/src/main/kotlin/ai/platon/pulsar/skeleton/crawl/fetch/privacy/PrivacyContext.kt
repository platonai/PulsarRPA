/**
 * A privacy context is a unique context of a privacy agent to the target website,
 * it will be closed once it is leaked.
 *
 * One of the biggest difficulties in web scraping tasks is the bot stealth.
 *
 * For web scraping tasks, the website should have no idea whether a visit is
 * from a human being or a bot. Once a page visit is suspected by the website,
 * which we call a privacy leak, the privacy context has to be dropped,
 * and PulsarRPA will visit the page in another privacy context.
