== üöÑ Get started

üíñ PulsarRPA is All You Need! üíñ

PulsarRPA is the ultimate open source solution to scrape Web data at scale, based on high performance, distributed RPA.

Extracting Web data at scale is extremely hard. Websites change frequently and are becoming more complex, meaning web data collected is often inaccurate or incomplete, PulsarRPA has developed a range of cutting-edge technologies to solve this problem.

*Most scraping attempts can start with (almost) a single line of code:*

*Kotlin:*
[source,kotlin,options="nowrap"]
----
fun main() = PulsarContexts.createSession().scrapeOutPages(
  "https://www.amazon.com/", "-outLink a[href~=/dp/]", listOf("#title", "#acrCustomerReviewText"))
----

The code above scrapes fields specified by CSS selectors #title and #acrCustomerReviewText from a set of product pages.

Example code: link:pulsar-app/pulsar-examples/src/main/kotlin/ai/platon/pulsar/examples/sites/topEc/english/amazon/AmazonCrawler.kt[kotlin].

*Most #real world# crawl projects can start with the following code snippet:*

*Kotlin:*
[source,kotlin]
----
fun main() {
    val context = PulsarContexts.create()

    val parseHandler = { _: WebPage, document: FeaturedDocument ->
        // use the document
        // ...
        // and then extract further hyperlinks
        context.submitAll(document.selectHyperlinks("a[href~=/dp/]"))
    }
    val urls = LinkExtractors.fromResource("seeds10.txt")
        .map { ParsableHyperlink("$it -refresh", parseHandler) }
    context.submitAll(urls).await()
}
----

Example code: link:pulsar-app/pulsar-examples/src/main/kotlin/ai/platon/pulsar/examples/_5_ContinuousCrawler.kt[kotlin], link:pulsar-app/pulsar-examples/src/main/java/ai/platon/pulsar/examples/ContinuousCrawler.java[java].

*The #most complicated# crawl challenges can be resolved with advanced RPA:*

*Kotlin:*

[source,kotlin]
----
val options = session.options(args)
val event = options.event.browseEvent
event.onBrowserLaunched.addLast { page, driver ->
    // warp up the browser to avoid being blocked by the website,
    // or choose the global settings, such as your location.
    warnUpBrowser(page, driver)
}
event.onWillFetch.addLast { page, driver ->
    // have to visit a referrer page before we can visit the desired page
    waitForReferrer(page, driver)
    // websites may prevent us from opening too many pages at a time, so we should open links one by one.
    waitForPreviousPage(page, driver)
}
event.onWillCheckDocumentState.addLast { page, driver ->
    // wait for a special fields to appear on the page
    driver.waitForSelector("body h1[itemprop=name]")
    // close the mask layer, it might be promotions, ads, or something else.
    driver.click(".mask-layer-close-button")
}
// visit the URL and trigger events
session.load(url, options)
----

Example code: link:pulsar-app/pulsar-examples/src/main/kotlin/ai/platon/pulsar/examples/sites/food/dianping/RestaurantCrawler.kt[kotlin].

*The #most complicated# Web data extraction problems can be handled by X-SQL:*

1. Your Web data extraction rules are very complex, for example, 100+ rules for each individual page
2. There are a lot of data extraction rules to maintain, for example, 20+ Amazon websites worldwide, 20+ data types for each website

[source,sql,dialect=H2]
----
select
      dom_first_text(dom, '#productTitle') as title,
      dom_first_text(dom, '#bylineInfo') as brand,
      dom_first_text(dom, '#price tr td:matches(^Price) ~ td, #corePrice_desktop tr td:matches(^Price) ~ td') as price,
      dom_first_text(dom, '#acrCustomerReviewText') as ratings,
      str_first_float(dom_first_text(dom, '#reviewsMedley .AverageCustomerReviews span:contains(out of)'), 0.0) as score
  from load_and_select('https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C1H26C46 -i 1s -njr 3', 'body');

== ü•Å Introduction

Extracting Web data at scale is extremely hard. #Websites change frequently and are becoming more complex, meaning web data collected is often inaccurate or incomplete#, PulsarRPA has developed a range of cutting-edge technologies to solve this problem.

We have released complete solutions for site-wide Web scraping for some of the largest e-commerce websites. These solutions meet the highest standards of performance, quality and cost. They will be free and open source forever, such as:

* link:https://github.com/platonai/exotic-amazon[Exotic Amazon]
* link:https://github.com/platonai/exotic/tree/main/exotic-app/exotic-OCR-examples/src/main/kotlin/ai/platon/exotic/examples/sites/walmart[Exotic Walmart]
* link:https://github.com/platonai/exotic/tree/main/exotic-app/exotic-OCR-examples/src/main/kotlin/ai/platon/exotic/examples/sites/food/dianping[Exotic Dianping]

üï∑ *PulsarRPA supports high-quality, large-scale Web data collection and processing.* We have developed a range of infrastructure and cutting-edge technologies to ensure the highest standards of performance, quality and TCO (total cost of ownership), even in very large-scale data collection scenarios.

üè™ *PulsarRPA supports the Network-As-A-Database paradigm.* PulsarRPA treats the external network as a database. If the required data is not in the local storage, or the existing version does not meet the analysis needs, the system will collect the latest version of the data from the Internet. We also developed X-SQL to query the Web directly and convert webpages into tables and charts.

üåà **PulsarRPA supports browser rendering as the primary method to collect Web data.** By using browser rendering as the primary method to collect Web data, we achieve an optimal balance between data point scale, data quality, labor cost and hardware cost, and achieve the lowest TCO (total cost of ownership). With optimizations such as blocking unnecessary resource files, the performance of browser rendering can even be comparable to the traditional single resource collection method.

üí´ *PulsarRPA supports RPA based Web scraping.* PulsarRPA includes an RPA subsystem for Web interaction: scrolling, typing, screen capture, dragging and dropping, clicking, etc. This subsystem is similar to the well-known selenium, playwright, puppeteer, but all behaviors are optimized, such as more realistic simulation, better execution performance, better parallelism, better fault tolerance, and so on.

üî™ *PulsarRPA supports single resource collection.* PulsarRPA's default data collection method is to harvest the `complete` Web data through browser rendering, but if the data you need can be retrieved through a single link, for example, it can be returned through an ajax interface, you can also call PulsarRPA's resource collection method for super High-speed collection.

üíØ *PulsarRPA plans to support cutting-edge information extraction technology.* We plan to release an advanced AI to automatically extract every field from all valuable webpages (e.g. product detail pages) with remarkable accuracy, and we currently offer a https://github.com/platonai/exotic#run-auto-extract[preview] version.

== üöÄ Features

* Web spider: browser rendering, ajax data crawling
* RPA: robotic process automation, mimic human behaviors, SPA crawling, or do something else valuable

* Bot stealth: web driver stealth, IP rotation, privacy context rotation, never get banned
* High performance: highly optimized, rendering hundreds of pages in parallel on a single machine without be blocked
* Low cost: scraping 100,000 browser rendered e-comm webpages, or n * 10,000,000 data points each day, only 8 core CPU/32G memory are required
* Data quantity assurance: smart retry, accurate scheduling, web data lifecycle management
* Large scale: fully distributed, designed for large scale crawling
* Big data: various backend storage support: Local File/MongoDB/HBase/Gora
* Logs &amp; metrics: monitored closely and every event is recorded
* [Preview] Information Extraction: Learns Web data patterns and automatically extracts every field in a webpage with remarkable precision

== ‚ôæ Core concepts

The core PulsarRPA concepts include the following, knowing these core concepts, you can use PulsarRPA to solve the most demanding data scraping tasks:

* Web Scraping: the process of using bots to extract content and data from a website
* Auto Extract: learn the data schema automatically and extract every field from webpages, powered by cutting-edge AI algorithm
* RPA: stands for robotic process automation which is the only way to scrape modern webpages
* Network As A Database: access the network just like a database
* X-SQL: query the Web using SQL directly
* Pulsar Session: provides a set of simple, powerful and flexible APIs to do web scraping tasks
* Web Driver: defines a concise interface to visit and interact with webpages, all behaviors are optimized to mimic real people as closely as possible
* URLs: a URL in PulsarRPA is a normal link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URL[URL] with extra information to describe a task. Every task in PulsarRPA is defined as some form of URL
* Hyperlinks: a Hyperlink in PulsarRPA is a normal link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperlink[Hyperlink] with extra information to describe a task
* Load Options: load options, or load arguments are control parameters that affect how PulsarRPA loads, fetches and crawls webpages
* Event Handlers: capture and process events throughout the lifecycle of webpages

Check link:docs/concepts.adoc#_the_core_concepts_of_pulsar[PulsarRPA concepts] for details.

== üßÆ PulsarRPA as an executable jar

We have released a standalone executable jar based on PulsarRPA, which includes:

* Web scraping examples of a set of top sites
* An applet based on `self-supervised` machine learning for information extraction, AI identifies all fields on the detail page with over 90% field accuracy of 99.9% or more
* An applet based on `self-supervised` machine learning and outputs all extract rules, which can help traditional Web scraping methods
* An applet that scrape Web data directly from the command line, like wget or curl, without writing code
* An upgraded PulsarRPA server to which we can send SQLs to collect Web data
* A Web UI from which we can write SQLs and send them to the server

Download https://github.com/platonai/exotic#download[Exotic] and explore its capabilities with a single command line:

    java -jar exotic-standalone.jar

You can also start your own large-scale web crawler projects based on our commercial-grade open source projects: link:https://github.com/platonai/exotic[Exotic], link:https://github.com/platonai/exotic-amazon[Exotic-amazon].

=== Basic usage

*Kotlin:*

[source,kotlin]
----
// Create a pulsar session
val session = PulsarContexts.createSession()
// The main url we are playing with
val url = "https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C1H26C46"

// Load a page from local storage, or fetch it from the Internet if it does not exist or has expired
val page = session.load(url, "-expires 10s")

// Submit a url to the URL pool, the submitted url will be processed in a crawl loop
session.submit(url, "-expires 10s")

// Parse the page content into a document
val document = session.parse(page)
// do something with the document
// ...

// Load and parse
val document2 = session.loadDocument(url, "-expires 10s")
// do something with the document
// ...

// Load the portal page and then load all links specified by `-outLink`.
// Option `-outLink` specifies the cssSelector to select links in the portal page to load.
// Option `-topLinks` specifies the maximal number of links selected by `-outLink`.
val pages = session.loadOutPages(url, "-expires 10s -itemExpires 10s -outLink a[href~=/dp/] -topLinks 10")

// Load the portal page and submit the out links specified by `-outLink` to the URL pool.
// Option `-outLink` specifies the cssSelector to select links in the portal page to submit.
// Option `-topLinks` specifies the maximal number of links selected by `-outLink`.
session.submitOutPages(url, "-expires 1d -itemExpires 7d -outLink a[href~=/dp/] -topLinks 10")

// Load, parse and scrape fields
val fields = session.scrape(url, "-expires 10s", "#centerCol",
    listOf("#title", "#acrCustomerReviewText"))

// Load, parse and scrape named fields
val fields2 = session.scrape(url, "-i 10s", "#centerCol",
    mapOf("title" to "#title", "reviews" to "#acrCustomerReviewText"))

// Load, parse and scrape named fields
val fields3 = session.scrapeOutPages(url, "-i 10s -ii 10s -outLink a[href~=/dp/] -topLink 10", "#centerCol",
    mapOf("title" to "#title", "reviews" to "#acrCustomerReviewText"))

// Add `-parse` option to activate the parsing subsystem
val page10 = session.load(url, "-parse -expires 10s")

// Kotlin suspend calls
val page11 = runBlocking { session.loadDeferred(url, "-expires 10s") }

// Java-style async calls
session.loadAsync(url, "-expires 10s").thenApply(session::parse).thenAccept(session::export)
----

Example code: link:pulsar-app/pulsar-examples/src/main/kotlin/ai/platon/pulsar/examples/_0_BasicUsage.kt[kotlin], link:pulsar-app/pulsar-examples/src/main/java/ai/platon/pulsar/examples/BasicUsage.java[java].

*Load options*

Most of our scrape methods accept a parameter called load options, or load arguments, to control how to load, fetch and scrape a webpage.

    -expires     // The expiry time of a page
    -itemExpires // The expiry time of item pages in batch scraping methods
    -outLink     // The selector of out links to scrape
    -refresh     // Force (re)fetch the page, just like hitting the refresh button on a real browser
    -parse       // Activate parse subsystem
    -resource    // Fetch the url as a resource without browser rendering

Check link:docs/concepts.adoc#_load_options[Load Options] for details.

=== Extracting web data

PulsarRPA uses https://jsoup.org/[jsoup] to extract data from HTML documents. Jsoup parses HTML to the same DOM as modern browsers do. Check https://jsoup.org/cookbook/extracting-data/selector-syntax[selector-syntax] for all the supported CSS selectors.

*Kotlin:*

[source,kotlin]
----
val document = session.loadDocument(url, "-expires 1d")
val price = document.selectFirst('.price').text()
----

=== Continuous crawls
It's really simple to scrape a massive url collection or run continuous crawls in PulsarRPA.

*Kotlin:*

[source,kotlin]
----
fun main() {
    val context = PulsarContexts.create()

    val parseHandler = { _: WebPage, document: FeaturedDocument ->
        // do something wonderful with the document
        println(document.getTitle() + "\t|\t" + document.getBaseUri())
    }
    val urls = LinkExtractors.fromResource("seeds.txt")
        .map { ParsableHyperlink("$it -refresh", parseHandler) }
    context.submitAll(urls)
    // feel free to submit millions of urls here
    context.submitAll(urls)
    // wait until all tasks are done
    context.await()
}
----

*Java:*

[source,java]
----
public class ContinuousCrawler {

    private static void onParse(WebPage page, FeaturedDocument document) {
        // do something wonderful with the document
        System.out.println(document.getTitle() + "\t|\t" + document.getBaseUri());
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        PulsarContext context = PulsarContexts.create();

        List<Hyperlink> urls = LinkExtractors.fromResource("seeds.txt")
                .stream()
                .map(seed -> new ParsableHyperlink(seed, ContinuousCrawler::onParse))
                .collect(Collectors.toList());
        context.submitAll(urls);
        // feel free to submit millions of urls here
        context.submitAll(urls);
        // wait until all tasks are done
        context.await();
    }
}
----

Example code: link:pulsar-app/pulsar-examples/src/main/kotlin/ai/platon/pulsar/examples/_9_MassiveCrawler.kt[kotlin], link:pulsar-app/pulsar-examples/src/main/java/ai/platon/pulsar/examples/ContinuousCrawler.java[java].

=== üëΩ RPA (Robotic Process Automation)

As websites become more and more complicated, RPA has become the only way to collect data from some website, such as websites using Custom Font technology.

PulsarRPA provides a convenient way to mimic real people during the lifecycle of a webpage, using a web driver to interact with the webpage: scrolling, typing, screen capturing, dragging and dropping, clicking and more, all actions and behaviors are optimized to mimic real people as closely as possible.

Here is a typical RPA code snippet, which is required to collect data from most top e-comm sites.

Kotlin:

[source,kotlin]
----
val options = session.options(args)
val event = options.event.browseEvent
event.onBrowserLaunched.addLast { page, driver ->
    // warp up the browser to avoid being blocked by the website,
    // or choose the global settings, such as your location.
    warnUpBrowser(page, driver)
}
event.onWillFetch.addLast { page, driver ->
    // have to visit a referrer page before we can visit the desired page
    waitForReferrer(page, driver)
    // websites may prevent us from opening too many pages at a time, so we should open links one by one.
    waitForPreviousPage(page, driver)
}
event.onWillCheckDocumentState.addLast { page, driver ->
    // wait for a special fields to appear on the page
    driver.waitForSelector("body h1[itemprop=name]")
    // close the mask layer, it might be promotions, ads, or something else.
    driver.click(".mask-layer-close-button")
}
// visit the URL and trigger events
session.load(url, options)
----

Example code: link:pulsar-app/pulsar-examples/src/main/kotlin/ai/platon/pulsar/examples/sites/food/dianping/RestaurantCrawler.kt[kotlin].

=== Use X-SQL to query the web

Scrape a single page:

[source,sql,dialect=H2]
----
select
      dom_first_text(dom, '#productTitle') as title,
      dom_first_text(dom, '#bylineInfo') as brand,
      dom_first_text(dom, '#price tr td:matches(^Price) ~ td, #corePrice_desktop tr td:matches(^Price) ~ td') as price,
      dom_first_text(dom, '#acrCustomerReviewText') as ratings,
      str_first_float(dom_first_text(dom, '#reviewsMedley .AverageCustomerReviews span:contains(out of)'), 0.0) as score
  from load_and_select('https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C1H26C46 -i 1s -njr 3', 'body');
----

Execute the X-SQL:

[source,kotlin]
----
val context = SQLContexts.create()
val rs = context.executeQuery(sql)
println(ResultSetFormatter(rs, withHeader = true))
----

The result is as follows:

----
TITLE                                                   | BRAND                  | PRICE   | RATINGS       | SCORE
HUAWEI P20 Lite (32GB + 4GB RAM) 5.84" FHD+ Display ... | Visit the HUAWEI Store | $6.10 | 1,349 ratings | 4.40
----

Example code: link:pulsar-app/pulsar-examples/src/main/kotlin/ai/platon/pulsar/examples/_10_XSQL.kt[kotlin].

Click link:docs/x-sql.adoc[X-SQL] to see a detailed introduction and function descriptions about X-SQL.

== üåê PulsarRPA as a REST service
When PulsarRPA runs as a REST service, X-SQL can be used to scrape webpages or to query the web data directly at anytime, from anywhere, without opening an IDE.

=== Build from source
----
git clone https://github.com/platonai/pulsar.git
cd pulsar && bin/build-run.sh
----
For Chinese developers, we strongly suggest you to follow link:bin/tools/maven/maven-settings.adoc[this] instruction to accelerate the building.

=== Use X-SQL to query the web

Start the pulsar server if not started:

[source,shell]
----
bin/pulsar
----

Scrape a webpage in another terminal window:

[source,shell]
----
bin/scrape.sh
----

The bash script is quite simple, just use curl to post an X-SQL:

[source,sql]
----
curl -X POST --location "http://localhost:8182/api/x/e" -H "Content-Type: text/plain" -d "
  select
      dom_base_uri(dom) as url,
      dom_first_text(dom, '#productTitle') as title,
      str_substring_after(dom_first_href(dom, '#wayfinding-breadcrumbs_container ul li:last-child a'), '&node=') as category,
      dom_first_slim_html(dom, '#bylineInfo') as brand,
      cast(dom_all_slim_htmls(dom, '#imageBlock img') as varchar) as gallery,
      dom_first_slim_html(dom, '#landingImage, #imgTagWrapperId img, #imageBlock img:expr(width > 400)') as img,
      dom_first_text(dom, '#price tr td:contains(List Price) ~ td') as listprice,
      dom_first_text(dom, '#price tr td:matches(^Price) ~ td') as price,
      str_first_float(dom_first_text(dom, '#reviewsMedley .AverageCustomerReviews span:contains(out of)'), 0.0) as score
  from load_and_select('https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C1H26C46 -i 1d -njr 3', 'body');"
----

Example code: link:bin/scrape.sh[bash], link:bin/scrape.bat[batch], link:pulsar-client/src/main/java/ai/platon/pulsar/client/Scraper.java[java], link:pulsar-client/src/main/kotlin/ai/platon/pulsar/client/Scraper.kt[kotlin], link:pulsar-client/src/main/php/Scraper.php[php].

The response is as follows in json format:

== üìä Logs & Metrics

PulsarRPA has carefully designed the logging and metrics subsystem to record every event that occurs in the system.

PulsarRPA logs the status for every load execution, so it's easy to know what happened in the system, find out answers such as is the system running healthy, how many pages were successfully fetched, how many pages were retried, how many proxy ips were used, etc.

By paying attention to just a few symbols, you can gain insight into the state of the entire system: üíØ üíî üóô ‚ö° üíø üîÉ ü§∫„ÄÇ

Typical page loading logs are shown below, check link:docs/log-format.adoc[log-format] to learn how to read the logs and gain insight into the state of the entire system at a glance.
