Versioning Policy Since 1.10.20
==

Since 1.10.20, we ship different types of releases:

* Feature releases (1.x) that bring major changes in PulsarRPA.

* Incremental releases (1.x.y) that are shipped between feature releases and include updates in the tooling, performance improvements, and bug fixes.

* Bug fix releases (1.x.yz) that include bug fixes for incremental releases.

For example, for the feature release 1.10 we had several incremental releases including 1.10.20, 1.10.30, and 1.10.70. 
For 1.10.70, we had 2 bug fix releases – 1.10.71 and 1.10.72.

For each incremental and feature release, we also ship several preview (EAP) versions for you to try new features before they are released. See Early Access Preview for details.
