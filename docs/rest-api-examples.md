## 🎓 For Advanced Users – LLM + X-SQL

Use structured SQL-like queries combined with LLM extraction.

### Example Query

```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8182/api/x/e" \
  -H "Content-Type: text/plain" \
  -d "
    SELECT
      llm_extract(dom, 'product name, price, ratings') AS llm_extracted_data,
      dom_base_uri(dom) AS url,
      dom_first_text(dom, '#productTitle') AS title,
      dom_first_slim_html(dom, 'img:expr(width > 400)') AS img
    FROM load_and_select('https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C1H26C46', 'body');
  "
```


### Sample Output

```json
{
  "llm_extracted_data": {
    "product name": "Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max",
    "price": "$1,199.00",
    "ratings": "4.5 out of 5 stars"
  },
