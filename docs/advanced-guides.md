# PulsarRPA - Advanced Usage

## 🎁 PulsarRPA as a java library

The simplest way to leverage the power of PulsarRPA is to add it to your project as a library.

Maven:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>ai.platon.pulsar</groupId>
    <artifactId>pulsar-bom</artifactId>
    <version>VERSION</version>
</dependency>
```

Gradle:

```kotlin
implementation("ai.platon.pulsar:pulsar-bom:VERSION")
```

Clone the template project from github.com:
* [kotlin](https://github.com/platonai/pulsar-kotlin-template)
* [java-17](https://github.com/platonai/pulsar-java-17-template)

Start your own large-scale web crawling projects based on our commercial-grade open source projects: 
* [PulsarRPAPro](https://github.com/platonai/PulsarRPAPro)
* [Exotic-amazon](https://github.com/platonai/exotic-amazon)

# 🌐 PulsarRPA as a REST Service

When PulsarRPA runs as a REST service, X-SQL can be used to scrape webpages or to query web data directly at any time, from anywhere, without opening an IDE.

## Build from Source

```shell
git clone https://github.com/platonai/PulsarRPA.git
cd PulsarRPA && bin/build-run.sh
```

For Chinese developers, we strongly suggest you to follow [this](/bin/tools/maven/maven-settings.md) instruction to accelerate the building process.

## Use X-SQL to Query the Web

Start the pulsar server if it is not started:

```shell
bin/pulsar
```

Scrape a webpage in another terminal window:

Linux:

```shell
bin/scrape.sh
```

Windows:

```shell
bin/scrape.ps1
```
Or
```shell
bin/scrape.bat
```

The bash script is straightforward. It merely uses curl to send a POST request with an X-SQL.

```shell
curl -X POST --location "http://localhost:8182/api/scrape/tasks/execute" -H "Content-Type: text/plain" -d "
  select
      dom_base_uri(dom) as url,
      dom_first_text(dom, '#productTitle') as title,
      dom_first_slim_html(dom, 'img:expr(width > 400)') as img
  from load_and_select('https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C1H26C46', 'body');
"
```

Example code: [bash](bin/scrape.sh), [PowerShell](bin/scrape.ps1), [batch](bin/scrape.bat), [java](/ai/platon/pulsar/client/Scraper.java), [kotlin](/ai/platon/pulsar/client/Scraper.kt), [php](/src/main/php/Scraper.php).

# 📊 Logs & Metrics

PulsarRPA has carefully designed the logging and metrics subsystem to record every event that occurs in the system. PulsarRPA logs the status for every load execution, providing a clear and comprehensive overview of system performance. This detailed logging allows for quick assessment of the system’s health and efficiency. It answers key questions such as: Is the system operating smoothly? How many pages have been successfully retrieved? How many attempts were made to reload pages? And how many proxy IP addresses have been utilized? This information is invaluable for monitoring and troubleshooting purposes, ensuring that any issues can be promptly identified and addressed.

By focusing on a concise set of indicators, you can unlock a deeper understanding of the system’s overall condition: 💯 💔 🗙  ?💿 🔃 🤺.

Typical page loading logs are shown below. Check the [log-format](log-format.md) to learn how to read the logs and gain insight into the state of the entire system at a glance.
